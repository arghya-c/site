        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy playing football, chess and some card games or board games once in a while. I also enjoy formulating real life problems in terms of mathematics along with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like spending time with nature. Hence I enjoy going on treks, cycling and swimming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also interested in the mathematics in music and have recently started playing the piano and the flute.

            Anything intellectual seems to interest me, so feel free to contact me anytime.
